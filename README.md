Pretty simple: ezDOS.bat is the only file you should have to open. (unless you wanna delete any macros manually in the .txt file. Deleting from within ezDOS is something I'll try out in v1.1) And there'll be instructions at the top: /ez to create and save macros, /ezlist to view your current ones. Not sure if this is something that already exists or not--I coded a lot of small html projects as a kid and I'm just jumping back into this stuff head first. This seemed like a good place to start. Hopefully you can make ezDOS your go-to terminal! Enjoy :)
